# REPORT.LUA

Why i did it public ? 
Because i don't want to make money from free stuff, and i don't want to pay for host & accounts. Have fun pasting from it, or selling it.

**I know the code is messy but the goal was to work.**

Settings : 
1. In start.js line 15 (SteamAPIKey https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)
2. Line 101 (DiscordBot Token)
3. Bots.txt (format: username:password:)
4. Report.lua line 55 and 59 add webhook
5. node start.js
You can use the bot without the lua (!report <steamid64>)

To Do : 
1. Add proxy
2. Improve code and remove shit code from it
3. Fix lua (it work but is broken, read the code and u will understand)
4. Translate the code in English (is in Romanian)
